# Each line of instruction in this `externals.txt` file should contain the key for an external dependency listed in `config_user.yaml`.
# Lines beginning with # are ignored.
#
# For example, suppose your `config_user.yaml` file contains the following lines of text:
# > external:
# >     key: dependency
# 
# Now suppose your `externals.txt` file contains the following lines of text:
# > key
#
# Finally, suppose you run the following lines of code:
# > config_user = yaml.load(open('config_user.yaml', 'rb'))
# > mapping_dict = config_user['external']
# > create_external_links(paths, ['externals.txt'], mapping_dict)
# 
# This will create a link in `paths['external_dir']` named `key` that links to `dependency`.
