# Each line of instruction in this `inputs.txt` file should contain a symlink and target delimited by a `|`.
# Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# 
# For example, suppose your `inputs.txt` file contains the following lines of text:
# > symlink | target
#
# Now suppose you run the following lines of code:
# > create_input_links(paths, ['inputs.txt'])
# 
# This will create a link in `paths['input_dir']` named `symlink` that links to `target`.

# Symlink      | Target
